# Workflow

## **Workflow Description: Company Onboarding + User Setup**

### **Purpose**

This workflow is the foundational onboarding flow for a multi-tenant ERP system. It enables a superuser to register a new company (tenant), create the company‚Äôs first administrative user, and hand off access so that the company admin can manage their organization independently. The workflow also sets up the basic permission and session infrastructure required for all subsequent ERP operations.

---

### **Actors**

* **Superuser**: The system administrator responsible for onboarding new companies and their first admin users.
* **Company Admin**: The first user for a new company, who has administrative permissions within their own company (but not for others).

---

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Superuser Authentication**

   * Superuser logs into the ERP platform using secure credentials.

2. **Company Registration**

   * Superuser creates a new company by providing the required details (name, code, address).
   * The company record is stored and made available in the system.

3. **Company Admin User Creation**

   * Superuser creates the first user (admin) for the new company.
   * Assigns the ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù role to this user.
   * The admin user receives credentials for login.

4. **Company Admin Authentication**

   * The new admin logs in with their credentials.
   * System establishes a session and enforces role-based permissions.

5. **Company Admin Dashboard Access**

   * Upon successful login, the company admin lands on a dashboard/welcome page tailored to their company.
   * The admin can view company information and (optionally) proceed to onboard additional users or configure company settings.

6. **Role and Permission Enforcement**

   * All APIs and UIs enforce role-based permissions.
   * Only superusers can onboard new companies and admins.
   * Company admins can only manage data within their own company.

7. **Session Management**

   * The system manages login/logout for both superuser and company admin, maintaining secure and separate sessions.

---

### **Key Features**

* **Multi-tenant architecture**: Each company‚Äôs data is isolated.
* **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Only users with correct roles can perform onboarding steps.
* **End-to-end onboarding**: Covers both backend (API) and frontend (UI) for registration, login, and basic user management.
* **Auditability**: (Optional for future) System logs each onboarding action for security and compliance.

---

### **Outcome**

After this workflow:

* A new company (tenant) exists in the ERP.
* Its first admin user can securely log in and begin managing the organization.
* Permissions, roles, and session management are in place to support all future ERP operations.
