# Tasks

All tasks from `tests.md` related to SKU generation and code management are now implemented. Company and category codes are autogenerated for existing records, products have migrated SKUs with legacy references, and tests cover the full workflow including migrations.
Code regeneration endpoints were removed so codes remain immutable once created.
